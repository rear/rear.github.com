## Community support
For voluntary community support open an issue via the
[New issue](http://github.com/rear/rear/issues)
button at GitHub and fill in the needed information.

Please visit the [Development](/development/) page for information on
how to collaborate on the project and discuss issues.

We expect users to try the latest release, understand the basic concepts of
Relax-and-Recover and provide us with as much detail as possible regarding
the experienced problem(s) in order to quickly resolve user problems.
The details we require may include:

- Relax-and-Recover version and distribution version information
- Any custom configuration (from */etc/rear/*)
- Any related screen output
- Logfile (from */var/log/rear/*) with debugging enabled (```rear -Dv```)

Rest assured, the Relax-and-Recover developers do not like bugs either
and are very grateful for reported issues and improvements, preferably
with details.

If you like our work, and you are not seeking for professional support,
then [donations](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?item_name=Donation+to+Relax+and+Recover&cmd=_donations&business=gratien.dhaese%40gmail.com)
are gladly accepted as a token of appreciation.

We also foresee other means for [sponsoring](sponsors)
