title: Relax-and-Recover Usage Scenarios
---

## Recovery from USB

Prepare your rescue media using

    rear format /dev/sdX

It will be labeled REAR-000. The `/etc/rear/local.conf` can be as simple as:

    OUTPUT=USB
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL="usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000"

Run `rear -v mkbackup` to create the rescue media including the archive of the Operating System.

## Rescue system

Relax-and-Recover will *not* automatically add itself to the Grub bootloader.
It copies itself to your `/boot` folder.

To enable this, add

    GRUB_RESCUE=1

to your local configuration.

The entry in the bootloader is password protected. The default password is REAR.
Change it in your own `local.conf`

    GRUB_RESCUE_PASSWORD="SECRET"

## Storing on a central NFS server

The most straightforward way to store your DR images is using a central NFS
server. The configuration below will store both a backup and the rescue CD in a
directory on the share.

    OUTPUT=ISO
    BACKUP=NETFS
    BACKUP_URL="nfs://192.168.122.1/nfs/rear/"

## Backup integration

Relax-and-Recover integrates with [many backup solutions](/#rear-backup-methods). Your backup
software takes care of backing up all system files, Relax-and-Recover
recreates the filesystems and starts the file restore.

The following `/etc/rear/local.conf` uses a USB stick for the rescue system and Bareos for backups. It relies on your Bareos infrastructure to restore all files.

    BACKUP=BAREOS
    OUTPUT=USB
    OUTPUT_URL="usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000"

## Monitoring integration

Relax-and-Recover integrates with your monitoring. The `rear checklayout`
command will tell you if the most recent rescue environment deviates from
your storage configuration (e.g. LVM changes, filesystem resized, ...)

In good Unix tradition `rear checklayout` returns 0 if your system is in
sync with your rescue image.  A return code of 1 should lead to a red
light in your monitoring screen because a new rescue image is needed. Create
a rescue image and the next time `rear checklayout` runs, it will return
0 again, and your monitoring will switch to green.

You can also automate the creation of rescue images by adding a cron job for
`/usr/sbin/rear checklayout || /usr/sbin/rear mkrescue`. And make sure the
`OUTPUT_URL` points to a central location for storing your rescue images.
By default, a rear installation via a package manager will automatically install
a cron entry - see:

     # cat /etc/cron.d/rear
     30 1 * * * root /usr/sbin/rear checklayout || /usr/sbin/rear mkrescue

Furthermore, rear will write an exit code to the `/var/log/messages` file which
you could use to search via an integrated monitoring system (search for the *rear* keyword).
