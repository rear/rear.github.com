## Community support
For voluntary community support, you can use the
[issue-tracker](http://github.com/rear/rear/issues), the
[rear-users mailinglist](http://lists.relax-and-recover.org/mailman/listinfo/rear-users)
or the [chat channel](https://gitter.im/rear/rear)..

Please visit the [Development](/development/) page for information on
how to collaborate on the project and discuss issues.

We expect users to try the latest release, understand the basic concepts of
Relax-and-Recover and provide us with as much detail as possible regarding
the experienced problem(s) in order to quickly resolve user problems.
The details we require may include:

- Relax-and-Recover version and distribution version information
- Any custom configuration (from */etc/rear/*)
- Any related screen output
- Logfile (from */var/log/rear/*) with debugging enabled (```rear -Dv```)

Rest assured, the Relax-and-Recover developers do not like bugs either
and are very grateful for reported issues and improvements, preferably
with details.
